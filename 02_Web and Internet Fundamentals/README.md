# Web and Internet Fundamentals

## Network 
All the resources(computer, laptop, mobile, xyz..) that could be connected with each other and communicate, the system as a whole called the network.
OR
A network is a group of interconnected devices (like computers, servers, smartphones, etc.) that can communicate and share resources with each other.

Note: In network the connect could be wired or wireless like as printer connected with computer and mobile connected with the router.

#### üîπ Example:
```
When you connect your laptop to a Wi-Fi router, you're joining a local network.

```
| Type                                | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LAN (Local Area Network)**        | Covers a small area like a home, office, or school.                               |
| **WAN (Wide Area Network)**         | Covers a large area, often made by connecting multiple LANs (e.g., the Internet). |
| **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** | Spans a city or large campus.                                                     |
| **PAN (Personal Area Network)**     | Very small network, like Bluetooth between your phone and laptop.                 |


## Internet
A global system exiting all entities called internet.It is a network of networks.
OR
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that allows devices around the world to communicate and share data using a standard set of rules called protocols (mainly TCP/IP).


### üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies Behind the Internet:
#### IP Address: 
Unique address for each device on the internet

#### DNS: 
Like a phone book; it translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses

####  HTTP/HTTPS: 
Protocols used for accessing web pages

#### TCP/IP: 
Rules that ensure data is delivered accurately and in the right order

#### Example:
```
When you type www.google.com in your browser:

Your computer sends a request over the Internet to Google‚Äôs servers.

Google‚Äôs server processes it and sends back the search page.
```

## Browser
A browser, or web browser, is a software application used to access, retrieve, and display content from the World Wide Web (WWW).

It allows users to view web pages, play videos, submit forms, and interact with websites.

| Browser         | Developer          |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Google Chrome   | Google             |
| Mozilla Firefox | Mozilla Foundation |
| Safari          | Apple              |
| Microsoft Edge  | Microsoft          |
| Opera           | Opera Software     |

## üñ•Ô∏è Client and Server: Explained Simply
In web development and networking, Client and Server are two key roles in how the internet works.

### Client
A Client is a device or software (like a web browser) that requests data or services from a server.

üîπ Examples:
```
Your laptop or phone browsing a website

A browser like Chrome sending a search request to Google

A mobile app fetching your Instagram feed
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Server
A Server is a powerful computer or program that listens for requests and sends back responses or data.

üîπ Examples:
```
A server that hosts a website

Google‚Äôs search servers

A file server storing user documents
```

## How They Work Together

1. Client sends request to the server
E.g., "Show me the homepage of example.com"

2. Server processes the request
It might query a database or fetch files

3. Server sends response back to the client
It sends HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or data

4. Client displays the result to the user
You see the website or app content

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Terms

| Term           | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Request**    | Message sent from client to server asking for something    |
| **Response**   | Message sent from server back to the client with data      |
| **API**        | A set of rules that lets the client and server communicate |
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | Protocols used to send data between client and server      |
