Grid CSS Practice Assignment

Instructions:
Complete the following tasks to practice your CSS Grid skills. Write your code in a separate HTML and CSS file.

1. Create a container with the class "grid-container".
2. Inside the container, add 6 child divs with the class "grid-item". Number them 1 to 6.
3. Use CSS Grid to arrange the items in a 3-column layout.
4. Add a gap of 20px between the grid items.
5. Make the first grid item span 2 columns.
6. Make the last grid item span 2 rows.
7. Add a background color and some padding to each grid item for better visibility.

Bonus:
- Make the grid responsive so that on screens smaller than 600px, it switches to a single column layout.
