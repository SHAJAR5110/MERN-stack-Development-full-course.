# HTML Basics 

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to HTML
We began with the basic structure of an HTML document, including the use of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### 2. Emmet
We explored Emmet abbreviations in VS Code to rapidly write HTML. This helped us auto-generate elements like lists, divs, and nested structures efficiently.

### 3. Grouping Elements
We used the `<div>` tag to group content into sections for layout purposes. This is useful for organizing HTML documents visually and semantically.

### 4. div Tag
The `<div>` tag acts as a block-level container used to wrap elements together. It is often styled using CSS.

### 5. Block vs Inline Elements
We studied the difference between block elements (like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`) and inline elements (like `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`).

### 6. Lists and Nested Structures
We created ordered and unordered lists. We also practiced nesting lists to represent hierarchical structures.

### 7. Anchor Tag Variations
We explored how to create hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag â€” including external links, mailto links, and internal navigation.

### 8. Revision
Finally, we reviewed all concepts by building a small layout using grouping, navigation, and content elements.
