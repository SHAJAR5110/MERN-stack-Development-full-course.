## Introduction
In this session, we explored the use of HTML tables to organize and present data in a structured format. Tables are essential for displaying tabular data like records, scores, and reports.

## What is a Table?
An HTML table consists of rows and columns. Each row is defined using `<tr>`, headers with `<th>`, and data cells with `<td>`. Tables can be customized using attributes like `border`, `colspan`, and `rowspan`.

## Examples Covered
- **Basic Table** with headers and rows.
- **Advanced Table** using `rowspan` and `colspan` to merge cells and improve layout.

## Homework
Students are assigned to create tables showing student records and practice using advanced features like merged rows and columns.
