# HTML Forms 

## Introduction
This session focused on HTML forms, which allow users to enter and submit data on a website. Forms are essential for tasks like registration, login, feedback, and surveys.

## What is a Form?
A form is a structured area in HTML where users can fill in information. Forms are created using the `<form>` tag and usually contain inputs, buttons, and other fields.

## Form Tags
We studied several form-related tags including `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and `<button>`. These tags help create interactive and user-friendly interfaces.

| Tag                                  | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `<form>`                             | Main form container                   |
| `<input>`                            | User input fields (text, email, etc.) |
| `<label>`                            | Describes the input                   |
| `<textarea>`                         | Multiline text box                    |
| `<select>`                           | Dropdown menu                         |
| `<option>`                           | Options in dropdown                   |
| `<button>` / `<input type="submit">` | Submit button                         |



## Form Elements
We learned to add text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, text areas, and submit buttons â€” all essential parts of modern forms.

## Input Types
We explored various input types like `text`, `email`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `date`, and `file`. These types define the purpose and behavior of each input.

## Revision
We practiced combining all form elements into a basic "Register" form. This helped reinforce how to structure and group inputs correctly with labels and layout.
