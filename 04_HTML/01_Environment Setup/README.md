## 🛠️ Environment Setup for HTML

To start writing and testing HTML code efficiently, we recommend setting up your development environment using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Install VS Code

1. Go to the official website: [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download and install VS Code for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create a Project Folder

1. Create a new folder on your computer, e.g., `html-practice`.
2. Open VS Code.
3. Go to **File > Open Folder...** and select your new folder.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Create Your First HTML File

1. Inside your folder, click **New File** → name it `index.html`.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Install Live Server Extension

To view your HTML files in real-time in the browser:

1. In VS Code, go to **Extensions** (Sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search for **Live Server** by **Ritwick Dey**
3. Click **Install**
4. After installing, right-click on your `index.html` file and click **"Open with Live Server"**

Your default browser will open and show the live preview of your HTML page.

### ✅ Emmet Shortcuts in VS Code

Emmet is built-in and helps you write HTML faster. Try this:

* Type `!` and press `Tab` → Generates full HTML boilerplate.
